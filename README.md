# NTFY Reminders (totally vibecoded)

I do **not** know JavaScript. I do **not** know how Obsidian plugins work. This plugin is held together with vibes, logs, and a stubborn need to get reminders out of my notes and into my phone via **ntfy**. Use at your own delight/risk üòÑ

---

## How to use

### 1) Install (manual)

1. Create a folder in your vault: `.obsidian/plugins/ntfy-reminders/`
2. Drop `manifest.json` and `main.js` in there (the ones you‚Äôre running now).
3. In Obsidian ‚Üí **Settings ‚Üí Community plugins ‚Üí Installed plugins**, enable **NTFY Reminders**.
4. Open **Settings ‚Üí NTFY Reminders** and fill in your ntfy server/topic (and optional auth).

### 2) Insert a reminder time

You can put reminders anywhere in your Markdown. The plugin looks for **clock stamps** you insert like this:

```
‚è∞ 2025-09-01 9:00 AM
```

* 12-hour or 24-hour format is configurable in settings.
* Minutes are optional in typing (we‚Äôll still insert `HH:mm`).
* You can add recurrence by appending: `every 2 hours`, `every 1 days`, `every 3 weeks`, etc.

Examples:

```
Pay rent ‚è∞ 2025-09-01 9:00 AM
Drink water ‚è∞ 2025-08-16 14:00 every 2 hours
```

### 3) Fast entry with `@` or a hotkey

* Type `@` to open a **fuzzy time suggest**.

  * `@` alone shows smart presets (in 30m, tomorrow 09:00, etc.)
  * `@930` filters to times whose digits contain `9-3-0` in order (date+time window).
  * Picks are inserted as a proper clock stamp: `‚è∞ YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm [AM/PM]`.
* Press **Ctrl+R** (default) anywhere to open a small picker modal with the same fuzzy search and presets.

### 4) Tasks lines (optional)

For lines like:

```
- [ ] Call the bank ‚è∞ 2025-08-20 11:15 AM
```

* If you later change the **Tasks** status to certain characters (defaults: `x` done, `/` in-progress, `-` cancelled), the plugin will **suppress** reminders from that line. You can customize which status chars dismiss reminders in settings.

### 5) Only one machine sends (optional)

If you have multiple Obsidian instances on the same vault, you can choose which machine actually sends notifications:

* Set **Allowed hostnames** and/or **Allowed IPs/CIDRs** in settings.
* Only a matching machine will schedule and send. Others go ‚Äúsilent‚Äù.
* A status banner in settings shows what this device thinks it is: **SENDER** or **SILENT**, plus detected host/IPs.

## Features

* **Simple, explicit reminder stamps**
  Reminders are defined by `‚è∞ YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm [AM/PM]` anywhere in the line. This avoids fighting the Tasks plugin‚Äôs own date parser and keeps things predictable.

* **Recurrence**
  Add `every N minutes|hours|days|weeks` right after a clock stamp to repeat it. Example:
  `‚è∞ 2025-08-16 09:00 every 2 hours`

* **Multi-reminder per line**
  You can put multiple `‚è∞ ‚Ä¶` stamps on the same line; each is scheduled separately.

* **Priority mapping (emoji ‚Üí ntfy)**
  If the line includes these, we set ntfy priority:

  * üî∫ ‚Üí 5 (highest)
  * ‚è´ ‚Üí 4 (high)
  * üîº ‚Üí 3
  * üîΩ ‚Üí 2 (low)
  * ‚è¨ ‚Üí 1 (lowest)
    Default is 3.

* **ntfy integration**
  Sends to your ntfy server/topic with optional **Authorization** header, custom **Title**, **Tags**, and an **Icon URL** (so notifications show a custom image).

* **12-hour / 24-hour**
  Picker and insert format respect your setting.

* **Fuzzy `@` time suggest**
  Type `@` then digits to filter a time grid intelligently (down to configurable minute steps).
  `@2515` matches any date/time containing `2-5-1-5` in order.

* **Hotkey**
  Default **Ctrl+R** opens the reminder picker modal anywhere.

* **Sender gating (host/IP/CIDR)**
  Only the chosen machine schedules/sends so you won‚Äôt get duplicate notifications with multiple Obsidian instances on the same vault.

## Settings (and why they exist)

**NTFY**

* **Server URL**
  Your ntfy endpoint (e.g., `https://ntfy.example.com`).
  *Needed to actually send notifications.*
* **Topic**
  Topic to publish to (e.g., `tasks`).
  *Lets you separate different kinds of notifications.*
* **Authorization header** (optional)
  e.g., `Bearer XYZ`
  *For private ntfy topics / secured servers. Keep this secret.*
* **Notification title**
  The `X-Title` header (defaults to ‚ÄúNTFY Reminders‚Äù).
  *So you can brand your notifications.*
* **Tags** (optional)
  Comma-separated tags sent via `X-Tags`.
  *Handy for filtering or styling on the ntfy side.*
* **Icon URL** (optional)
  Sends `X-Icon`/`Icon` header with an image URL.
  *So your notifications have a nice icon.*

**Input & Formatting**

* **Fuzzy @ step (minutes)**
  Grid step for the suggestion list (default 5).
  *Controls the granularity of suggested times.*
* **Picker inserts 12-hour times**
  On = ‚Äú9:00 AM‚Äù, Off = ‚Äú09:00‚Äù.
  *Match your region/brain‚Äôs time style.*

**Tasks Integration**

* **Dismiss task statuses**
  Characters that suppress reminders on task lines (default `x/-`).
  *Stops reminders for tasks that are done/in-progress/cancelled based on your workflow.*

**Sender (who sends notifications)**

* **Allowed hostnames**
  Comma-separated list of exact hostnames that are allowed to send.
  *If set (and/or IPs/CIDRs set), only matching machines send. Others are silent.*
* **Allowed IPs/CIDRs**
  Comma-separated list like `10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.0.`
  *Lets you pin sending to a specific machine or subnet. Useful with multiple Obsidian instances.*

### Notes, limits, and troubleshooting

* **This is desktop-only.** It runs in Obsidian Desktop where the plugin code executes.
* **Console logs:** the plugin logs *a lot*. If something doesn‚Äôt fire, open the DevTools console and skim messages starting with `[NTFY Reminders]`.
* **Duplicates:** if you run Obsidian in more than one place on the same vault, set **Sender** rules so only one instance sends. (We may add broker-level dedupe later as an option.)
